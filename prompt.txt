Build a Git-like Version Control System with Secure Commit Tracking in Python.
Requirements:
•	Model the repository as a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG), where each node represents a commit and edges define parent-child relationships between commits.
•	Use SHA-256 cryptographic hashing to uniquely identify each commit and prevent tampering.
•	Integrate a Merkle Tree structure to verify the integrity of all files and changes within each commit:
o	Compute a hash for each file’s contents.
o	Construct a Merkle Tree where leaf nodes represent file hashes and the root hash represents the entire commit snapshot.
o	Store this Merkle root as part of each commit object to ensure data consistency.
•	Employ efficient data structures:
o	Hash maps (dicts) for commit retrieval.
o	Adjacency lists for version tracking.
o	Stacks for undo/rollback operations.
•	Implement essential version control commands:
o	init — initialize a repository.
o	add — stage files for commit.
o	commit — create a new commit with secure Merkle-root tracking.
o	branch — create and switch branches.
o	merge — merge branches and detect merge conflicts.
o	log — display commit history.
o	rollback — revert to previous commits using stack logic.
•	Design a Command-Line Interface (CLI) to execute these operations.
•	Implement an audit trail to maintain a full record of repository actions.
•	Include an optional visualization module to render the commit DAG (e.g., using networkx or matplotlib).
•	Follow OOP principles: create classes such as Repository, Commit, MerkleTree, Branch, and CLIHandler.
•	Write modular, well-documented code explaining algorithms and data structures used.
•	Ensure data integrity and verification via Merkle Trees and SHA-256 hashes.
•	Optionally plan for future features such as distributed synchronization and user authentication.
